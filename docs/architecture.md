# Compiler architecture

The EasyScript compiler is written in C11 and has no dependencies beyond the C standard library and POSIX. It compiles `.es` files to C and builds the C with the system compiler (`cc -O2`).

## The pipeline

```
source.es → lexer → parser → checker → C codegen → cc -O2 → program
            tokens   AST      symbols   generated C
            \_______ front end _______/  \_ back end _/
```

Every stage reports errors to one `Diag` context, and the driver prints them all at the end.

| Stage | Input → output | Job |
|---|---|---|
| **Lexer** | source text → tokens | Splits text into words, numbers, text, symbols, and `NEWLINE`/`INDENT`/`DEDENT`. It drops comments and filler words and lowercases words. It doesn't know what any word means. |
| **Parser** | tokens → AST | Recognizes sentence patterns, deterministically. An ambiguous or unknown sentence is an error with suggestions; it never guesses. |
| **Checker** | AST → AST + symbol table | Resolves names, checks types, and produces "did you mean" suggestions. |
| **Middle end** | (added later) | An intermediate representation and optimizations. |
| **C codegen** | checked AST → C source | Writes C. It never looks at source text. |
| **Driver** | | `src/main.c`: runs the passes in order, prints diagnostics, invokes `cc`, and cleans up temp files. |

**Boundaries:** each stage only talks to the next through shared data structures (tokens, the AST, and the symbol table). The parser never emits C, and codegen never reads source text. Every stage reports problems through one `Diag` context, and the driver prints them all at the end.

## Folder layout

The target layout:

```
src/main.c            driver
src/front/            lexer.c, parse_expr.c, parse_stmt.c, check.c
src/back/             codegen_c.c
src/common/           arena.c, util.c, diag.c, ast.h
runtime/              support code linked into generated programs
tests/                unit, lexer, program, error, and CLI tests
examples/             small programs that back the docs (all tested)
docs/                 this documentation
```

What exists today:

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| `src/common/arena.{c,h}` | Done. Arena allocator: all compiler memory comes from here and is freed at once. |
| `src/common/util.{c,h}` | Done. Growable string builder (`StrBuf`), dynamic arrays (`Vec`), edit distance. |
| `src/common/diag.{c,h}` | Done. Collects errors with source spans and notes, and prints them in the [standard format](errors.md). |
| `src/front/lexer.{c,h}` | Done. The new lexer, available through `easyscript tokens`. |
| `src/common/ast.{h,c}` | Done for expressions and simple statements. Tagged-union `Expr` and `Stmt` nodes from the arena, each with a `SourcePos` (span, line, column); statements also keep the verb as written. Blocks are lists of statements. Also includes the outline printer used by `easyscript ast`. |
| `src/front/parse.h`, `parse_internal.h` | The parser's public API (`parse_program`), and the internal `Parser` context and helpers shared by the parser files. |
| `src/front/parse_util.c` | Token helpers, phrase matching (multi-word operators, with "Did you mean" for a missing last word), and error helpers. |
| `src/front/parse_expr.c` | Done. Recursive-descent expression parser. |
| `src/front/parse_stmt.c` | Done for simple statements: a table of statement forms, names (with filler and reserved-word errors), and the program loop. Blocks come next. |
| `src/front/check.c` | Coming soon |
| `src/back/codegen_c.c`, `runtime/` | Coming soon |
| `main.c` (repo root) | The driver. It moves to `src/main.c` as the new pipeline takes over. |
| `src/legacy.{c,h}`, `src/lexer.c`, `src/parser.c`, `src/codegen.c` | The 2024 prototype pipeline, which `run`/`build`/`emit` still use. It will be deleted when the new front and back ends replace it. |

## Code rules

These are the rules every module follows (the full list is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)):

- **Memory:** an arena for everything, no per-object `malloc`/`free`, and no fixed-size buffers (in the compiler or in generated C).
- **No global mutable state.** Context structs (`Compiler`, `Parser`, `Checker`, `Codegen`) are passed explicitly.
- **Small modules:** a small public header and private details in the `.c`. Opaque structs where other modules don't need the fields. Helpers are `static`. Files stay under about 600 lines, and functions are short and do one thing.
- **Errors go through `diag`,** with source spans, and a stage keeps going after an error, so one run reports everything.

## The CLI driver

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `easyscript run FILE` | Compile, build, run, and return the program's exit status |
| `easyscript build FILE -o OUT` | Compile and build an executable at `OUT` |
| `easyscript emit FILE` | Print the generated C |
| `easyscript tokens FILE` | Print the lexer's tokens (`KIND line:col text`), and any errors to stderr |
| `easyscript ast FILE` | Print the syntax tree as an indented outline (`node [line:col]`), and any errors to stderr |
| `easyscript` | Interactive shell (legacy syntax) |

Generated C and binaries go in a fresh temporary directory that's removed on exit. Nothing is written next to your source except `build`'s `-o` output. `cc` is started directly (`fork`/`exec`), never through a shell.

## Testing

`make test` runs:

| Suite | Location | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | `tests/unit/*.c` | Arena, string builder, arrays, edit distance, diagnostic formatting, lexer and parser internals (spans, recovery) |
| Lexer tests | `tests/tokens/` | Token output (`.out`) and exact error output (`.err`) |
| Parser tests | `tests/ast/` | Syntax tree output (`.out`) and exact error output (`.err`) |
| Program tests | `tests/run/` | Compile and run, compare stdout |
| Compile-error tests | `tests/errors/` | Exact compiler error output |
| Examples | `examples/legacy/`, `examples/lexer/`, `examples/parser/` | Every example in the docs, with its expected output |
| CLI checks | end of `tests/run.sh` | Commands, usage errors, temp-file cleanup |

`make test-debug` runs the same suite against a build with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. `make bless` rewrites the expected files from the current output, for intended changes only (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)).
